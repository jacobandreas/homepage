  <b>Questions about specific projects and papers:</b> We'd love to chat! Please
  make sure to include all authors in any correspondence.

  <b>Graduate admissions:</b>
  <u>I am currently uncertain about whether I will admit graduate students for
    the 2025 academic year.</u> (But there are many other people doing
  interesting work on machine learning and language at MIT, so please consider
  applying anyway!) Submit your application through the 
  <a href="https://gradapply.mit.edu/eecs/apply/login/?next=/eecs/"> graduate
  admissions portal</a> in the fall.
  Please read my <a href="advising.html">advising
  statement</a> if you're considering applying, and look at the group website
  for a sense of what we're working on. 
  See if you're eligible for a
  <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/graduate-admissions/applications/application-fee-waiver/">fee
  waiver</a>, and if
  if you're based in the US,
  check out the <a href="https://eecs-gaap.mit.edu/">Graduate Application
  Assistance Program</a>, which provides application writing support (and which
  many members of my lab are involved in).
  We receive a very large number of applications, so I unfortunately can't
  respond to individual emails about admissions. But we give every application
  submitted to the portal our careful attention!
  </p>

  <b>Postdocs:</b>
  <u>We are not conducting a formal postdoc search this year</u>, but we're
  always interested in talking to people working in related areas, and can
  sometimes arrange funding on an ad-hoc basis if there's a good research fit.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Internships:</b>
  MIT students should email me directly about UROP recruiting. If you're at
  another undergraduate institution in the US, you should apply to the
  <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/">MIT Summer Research Program</a> in
  December / January. Outside these two programs, we do not have any openings
  for visiting researchers, even with independent funding (and I can't respond to
  individual emails about visitor positions). High school students should apply
  to <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/">PRIMES</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Press and interviews:</b>
  If you're interested in talking about a specific paper from our group, or
  looking for a comment on a colleague's paper, I'd love to talk&mdash;please
  email me directly (you're most likely to be successful with at least a few
  day's notice). I'm not available for general language model explainers or
  comments on the state of artificial intelligence research. Media inquiries
  related to project CETI should be directed to David Gruber 
  (<a href="mailto:david@projectceti.org">david@projectceti.org</a>).
  </p>

  <b>Industry consulting and advising:</b>
  I am not currently available for paid or unpaid consulting for startups,
  product pitches, etc.
