  <b>Questions about specific projects and papers:</b> We'd love to chat! If this
  is a project for which I'm a senior advisor, please make sure to include
  the other authors in any correspondence.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Graduate admissions:</b>
  <u>I am planning to admit graduate students for
  the 2024 academic year.</u> 
  Apply through the <a
  href="https://gradapply.mit.edu/eecs/apply/login/?next=/eecs/"> graduate
  admissions portal</a> in the fall.
  Please read my <a href="advising.html">advising
  statement</a> if you're considering applying, and look at the group website
  for a sense of what we're working on. If you're based in the US, you should
  also check out the <a href="https://eecs-gaap.mit.edu/">Graduate Application
  Assistance Program</a>, which several of my students participate in.
  We receive a very large number of applications, so I unfortunately can't
  respond to individual emails about admissions. But we give every application
  submitted to the portal our careful attention!
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Postdocs:</b>
  <u>We are not conducting a formal postdoc search this year</u>, but we're
  always interested in talking to people working in related areas, and can
  sometimes arrange funding on an ad-hoc basis if there's a good research fit.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Internships:</b>
  MIT students should email me directly about UROP recruiting. If you're at
  another institution in the US, you should apply to the
  <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/msrp/">MIT Summer Research Program</a> in
  December / January. Outside these two programs, we do not have any openings
  for visiting researchers, even with independent funding (and I can't respond to
  individual emails about visitor positions).
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Press and interviews:</b>
  If you're interested in talking about a specific paper from our group, or
  looking for a comment on a colleague's paper, I'd love to talk&mdash;please
  email me directly (you're most likely to be successful with at least a few
  day's notice). I'm not available for general language model explainers or
  comments on the state of artificial intelligence research. Media inquiries
  related to project CETI should be directed to David Gruber 
  (<a href="mailto:david@projectceti.org">david@projectceti.org</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Industry consulting and advising:</b>
  I am not currently available for paid or unpaid consulting for startups,
  product pitches, etc.
