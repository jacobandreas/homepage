<h2>Filter Bubbles</h2>

Last week, we looked at collaborative filtering and came to understand the power
of estimating how we might fill in unknown entries in a matrix containing users’
ranking of content. In this question, we will consider some of the caveats
associated with using these techniques.

<b>4A)</b> Consider a political issue with sides A and B. How would
collaborative filtering respond to a user who tends to prefer content siding
with A? Discuss how this may affect political campaigns.

<b>4B)</b> If a user gives a positive signal (say, a like on Facebook or a
rating of 5 stars on some other platform (or even just continues to watch!)) to
content from A, between a piece of content from A and a piece of content from B,
which is the user more likely to see next? Then, assuming they give a positive
signal to that, what happens to content in the future?

<b>4C)</b> Consider content from a large corporation that has resources to
invest in advertising. As a result of a successful marketing campaign, their
content has received positive reviews from 60% of customers. Meanwhile, a small
content creator receives positive reviews from a smaller number of customers
(say, 20%). Which would appear to be more appealing to a new customer? What
implications might this have for someone without the marketing resources of a
large corporation?

These phenomena are broadly known as “filter bubbles.” While you wait for a
checkoff, read more about them:
