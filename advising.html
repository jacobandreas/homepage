  <h2>Advising statement</h2>

  <p>(<a href="index.html">back to home</a>)</p><br/>

  <p>My students currently work on two broad research themes: <i>generalization
    in natural language processing</i> (compositionality,
  systematicity and transfer) and <i>learning from language</i>
  (constructing and learning from natural language explanations in
  general machine learning settings). Here's a little about how we operate:<p>

  <p><b>Goals</b>&emsp;PhD programs are designed both to generate knowledge and
  to train new researchers. These functions are equally important, but I think
  it's more valuable for students to explore a broad set of problems, technical
  tools and collaboration styles than to produce a coherent body of work on a
  single topic. By the end of their time at MIT, students should have their own
  research agenda and the expertise to pursue it independently.
  </p>

  <p><b>Research style</b>&emsp;We're an NLP group, and value linguistic
  insight and expertise as much as machine learning expertise. Our current
  modeling toolkit involves lots of neural networks, though history suggests
  that this could change at any minute. The fact that we work with language data
  won't change. We try to avoid low-hanging fruit and tune our baseline models
  carefully. The function of papers is to generate insight, not fractional
  improvements in accuracy, and a successful project is one that shapes the way
  researchers think long after the specific model or task being described goes
  out of use.
  </p>

  <p><b>Group structure</b>&emsp;About half the current students came with
  previous NLP experience and the other half had other ML backgrounds. The group
  is currently four PhD students, some co-advised, and a rotating cast of
  undergrads and master's students. Individual interests range from databases to
  cognitive science. I expect the group to peak at nine or ten people, and
  to be six to eight at steady state. I prioritize personal interaction and want
  to play an active role in every project that my students are working on.  I
  also want to keep the group small enough that everyone knows (and has opinions
  about!) what everyone else is doing&mdash;peer mentoring is often more useful
  than top-down advising.
  </p>

  <p><b>Meetings</b>&emsp;I expect to meet with students one-on-one
  a minimum of once a week. (Some students also like to do short check-ins much
  more frequently.) These meetings can involve high-level project planning,
  low-level technical discussions, and general life / career chat. In
  addition to one-on-one meetings, we hold group meetings once a week which
  generally feature a paper discussion or practice talk.
  </p>

  <p><b>Life outside the lab</b>&emsp;We like to spend time on things other
  than research! Work&ndash;life balance is important for intellectual
  development, health and personal relationships. We organize group retreats once
  a year (this year we're going skiing), and many people are also involved in
  athletic, artistic or cultural pursuits outside the lab. The office is usually
  empty on weekends.
