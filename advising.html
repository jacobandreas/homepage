  <h2>Advising statement</h2>

  <p>(<a href="index.html">back to home</a>)</p><br/>

  <p>The language and intelligence group ("Lingo") currently works on two broad
  themes: <i>generalization in natural language processing</i>
  (compositionality, systematicity and transfer) and <i>learning from
  language</i> (generating and learning from natural language supervision in
  general machine learning settings). Here's a little about how we operate:<p>

  <p><b>Goals</b>&emsp;PhD programs are designed both to generate knowledge and
  to train new researchers. These functions are equally important, but I think
  it's more valuable for students to explore a broad set of problems, technical
  tools and collaboration styles than to produce a coherent body of work on a
  single topic. By the end of their time at MIT, students should have their own
  research agenda and the expertise to pursue it independently.
  </p>

  <p><b>Research style</b>&emsp;We're an NLP group, and value linguistic
  insight and expertise as much as machine learning expertise. Our current
  modeling toolkit involves lots of neural networks, though history suggests
  that this could change at any minute. The fact that we work with language data
  won't change. We try to avoid low-hanging fruit and tune our baseline models
  carefully.  The primary function of papers is to generate insight, not
  improvements on evaluation metrics. We generally don't work on problems with
  established leaderboards or shared tasks.
  A successful project is one that shapes the way researchers think long after
  the specific model or task being described goes out of use.
  </p>

  <p><b>Group structure</b>&emsp;About half the current students came with
  previous NLP experience and the other half had other ML backgrounds. The group
  is currently eight PhD students and three postdocs (many of whom are
  co-advised) along with a rotating group of visitors, undergrads and master's
  students. Individual interests range from databases to cognitive science. I
  expect the group to consist of six to eight PhD students and zero to two
  postdocs at steady state. I prioritize personal interaction and want to play
  an active role in every project that my students are working on. I also want
  to keep the group small enough that everyone knows (and has opinions about!)
  what everyone else is doing&mdash;peer mentoring is often more useful than
  top-down advising.
  </p>

  <p><b>Meetings</b>&emsp;I meet with most students once or twice a week for at
  least half an hour. For students involved in bigger group projects, at least
  one of these meetings is one-on-one. (Some people also like to do short
  check-ins much more frequently.) These meetings can involve high-level project
  planning, low-level technical discussions, and general life / career chat. In
  addition to one-on-one meetings, we hold (1) a formal meeting once a week
  which generally features an outside speaker or practice talk, and (2) a
  ''paper club'' with a more informal presentation on a paper or book chapter.
  </p>

  <p><b>Life outside the lab</b>&emsp;We like to spend time on things other
  than research! Work&ndash;life balance is important for intellectual
  development, health and personal relationships. We organize regular group
  outings (e.g. hikes, picnics, kayaking trips), and many people are also
  involved in athletic, artistic or cultural pursuits outside of MIT. The office
  is usually empty on weekends.
